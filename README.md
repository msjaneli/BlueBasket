# BlueBasket
A web app built to reimagine food waste at Duke.

# Instructions
Please run:
```
npm install
``` 
Run this in both client and root directories. This is because node_modules are not pushed to git and are required.

Within the client folder you can run:
``` npm start ```
This will start the react application on port 3000.

Within the root directory you can run:
``` node index.js ```
This will start the server.

# Structure
The root directory will contain the server file, along with route folders and controller folders (if necessary). The client folder contains the react application.
